Recurrence of Cancer Prediction using ML
Abstract— Recurrence is an important keystone in breast
cancer behavior, the most common cancer among the women is
breast cancer except skin cancer. Breast cancer can occur in
both men and women but its far more common in women.
According to a survey 13 percent women are affected by it all
over the world. This research evaluates several Machine
learning to detect and predict the recurrence of breast cancer;
and compare the used models by using different metrics like
accuracy, precision, etc.
Keywords—Cancer, Machine Learning, Predictive models,
classification

VI. CONCLUSION
Predicting recurrence is a key point in BC context. It’s a fact
that the researchers have tried to address this problem, but it
remains an open challenge. Based on the analysis, the works
utilizing the different ML approaches have an advantage
over working with a single technique.
The important aspect of this problem is not completely
addressed but the implementation of ML strategies is only
possible if the data has a enough records and also a balanced
dataset will be a plus point. In this task, we used four
different techniques for predicting the recurrence of Breast
cancer. After comparing the results, found that the random
forest is the best classifier predictor with the test dataset. if
we compare the accuracy then the RF and DT both have the
same accuracy but after comparing the values of the
confusion matrix, RF predicted more accurately than DT.
